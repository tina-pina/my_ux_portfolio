                  My main profession is web development. But as life is not black and white i also do not want to put myself in a drawer...
                  UX is a field that interests me already quite for some time and i have been looking for ways to include it my professional career. 
                  I recently got a professional diploma from UX Design Institute. As a part of that i did my first case study about hotel booking. 
                  I am looking forward to more UX experience and case studies in the future.
