                  My profession is web development, but I don't want to be pigeonholed since life is not black and white.
                  For quite some time I've been interested in UX and looking for ways to incorporate it into my career.

                  Recently I have received a professional diploma from the UX Design Institute and created my first case study about hotel booking. 
                  In the future I would like to work on more UX related topics and gain more experience.
